Machine learning section consists of Stanford university course from Coursera. Initial version has supervised learning algorythms, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression (both unregularized and regularized), Neural Networks Feedforward propagation and Backpropagation  implemented. Implemented with Matlab/Octave.
Every subsection has master file called ex**.m, designed to run the whole project. It was provided by Stanford university and wasn't modyfied. All calculations were made in support files.
