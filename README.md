Machine learning section consists of theoretical section with Stanford university course from Coursera and some practical Python cases. 

Theoretical section has supervised learning algorythms, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression (both unregularized and regularized), Neural Networks Feedforward propagation and Backpropagation  implemented. Implemented with Matlab/Octave.
Every subsection has master file called ex**.m, designed to run the whole project. It was provided by Stanford university and wasn't modified. All calculations were made in support files. Every section has its own readme file.

Python section includes several Python 3.7 projects completed during GeekBrains courses.
